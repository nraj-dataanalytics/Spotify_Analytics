## Data
The dashboard is built on a structured Spotify dataset containing:
- Song metadata
- Artist information
- Popularity scores
- Duration and release dates
- Content attributes (explicit flag, album type)

The dataset contains **28,000+ songs** across **300+ artists**, making performance optimization and efficient modeling a key focus.

## Data Preparation & Modeling
- Data cleaning and transformation performed using **Power Query**
- Optimized data model for handling large datasets
- Calculated fields and KPIs created using **DAX**
- Logical organization of fact and supporting tables for analysis

---

## Analytical Logic (DAX)
DAX measures were used to calculate:
- Aggregate KPIs (song count, artist count, averages)
- Popularity metrics and trends
- Content distributions
- Time-based aggregations

All analytical logic is documented in the project scripts.
